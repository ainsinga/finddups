finddups1.py is a PROTOTYPE program for finding DUPLICATE, UNCONFIRMED
entries in an ADIF file.  If one of the copies is confirmed, that is a
"keeper"!  (Not that you can do anything to the duplicate [or
incorrect] data in the ARRL LotW database.)  This is completely
unrelated to "dups" as in "dup sheets" or scoring for contests.

 * This program is not a finished product and should not be relied upon.
 * This program does not affect any databases, it just prints some output.
 * This program needs to be modified for your exact needs.
